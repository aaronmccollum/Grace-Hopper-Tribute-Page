                <p>Grace Hopper was born in New York City in 1906 to Walter Fletcher Murray and Mary Campbell Van Horne.  At an early age, Hopper showed constant curiosity to the way things worked.  As a child, she took several alarm clocks apart just to find out how they worked.  She studied math and physics at Vassar College and graduated in 1928, and she earned her master's Degree from Yale University two years later (she would go on to earn her Ph.D at Yale in 1934 in math).  When WWII began, she attempted to enlist but was too old at age 34.  Instead, she went back to Vassar College to be a professor.</p>
                <p>In 1943, she was able to join the U.S. Naval Reserves and take a leave of absence from Vassar College.  As a Reserve in the Navy, she worked on the programming staff of the Mark I computer at Harvard University.  In 1949, she joined the Eckertâ€“Mauchly Computer Corporation, where she began developing the idea that it was possible to write a computer language in English that could be understood by both humans and computers.  While quickly dismissed due to the perceived impossibility of the idea, she kept at it and created the first compiler that could translate words to machine code and worked on a language called COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language), which was one of the very first languages written in human language that could be translated to machine code.  To this day, COBOL is still used in some computer systems, both government and business.</p>
                <p>Without Grace Hopper, there is a good chance it would have been years before someone else developed a method to translate human-readable code into machine language.  Her creation of the compiler and her oversight with early programming languages helped pave the way for personal computers and new languages in the future years.  Today, languages like JavaScript, Python, and Java exist largely because of the work of Grace Hopper.</p>
